## Projects 
### Movie recommender system 
Developed an interactive web application to provide personalized movie recommendations based on title, director, or actor search.
•⁠  ⁠Implemented content-based filtering with precomputed similarity matrices to deliver top-5 recommendations in real time.
•⁠  ⁠Integrated TMDb API to dynamically fetch movie posters, enhancing user experience.
•⁠  ⁠Designed and deployed an intuitive Streamlit front-end with selection menus, search functionality, and multi-column layout.
•⁠  ⁠Processed and filtered metadata (cast, crew) using Pandas for accurate matching and improved recommendation precision.

### Chicken disease image classification
Built a Flask-based deep learning application to classify images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
•⁠  ⁠Designed REST API endpoints for training and prediction, with robust error handling and CORS support for external requests.
•⁠  ⁠Implemented image preprocessing pipeline to decode and prepare uploaded images for model inference.
•⁠  ⁠Integrated a minimal HTML/CSS interface for local testing and real-time predictions.
•⁠  ⁠Optimized CNN model to improve classification accuracy while maintaining low inference latency.

### Student Performance Prediction 
Created a machine learning web app to predict student exam performance from demographic and academic inputs.
•⁠  ⁠Developed preprocessing pipelines in scikit-learn for feature encoding and scaling of categorical and numerical data.
•⁠  ⁠Integrated a custom prediction pipeline to transform user inputs into model-ready format for real-time results.
•⁠  ⁠Designed interactive HTML front-end to collect inputs like gender, parental education, lunch type, and prep course status.
•⁠  ⁠Deployed on Streamlit cloud.
